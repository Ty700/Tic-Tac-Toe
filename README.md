# TicTacToeVsCPU-WIP
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that a user can play against the CPU. The CPU will always go first and will be the letter X.
- Project is on hold. 90% completed. It works. However, I plan on redoing this with classes and objects later on down the road. 
Since I have decided this, I will wait to implement the abstract CPU difficulty, choosing to go first or not, and other goals in the redo of this program. 
- Essentially, I plan on refactoring this whole program and add on top of the refactored code.
