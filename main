*   Description: This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that a user can play against the CPU. The user will always go first, and will always be the letter 'x'.
*   
*   To Do: 
        1. User side needs to work.
            a. Update board when the user enters where they want to place their x. - DONE 
                Ex: When the user enters "5", the board replaces 5 with an x, thus the board will have an X in the middle with 1-4, and 6-9 surrounding it in their respected field.
        2. Winning Outcomes
            a. Logic behind this is gonna be intense. 123, 456, 789, 147, 258, and 369, are all wining pairs. 
                Thinking about setting up a user vector. pushing back the user entries into the vector. after the user has their max of 5 turns, sorting the entries from least to greatest and 
                computing if the index to the left and right of indexs 1 and 4 are of a winning pattern described above.
                This will also be later updated to check after each entry of the user (and then CPU) so that if a user wins prior to 5 turns it ends game
            b. 
        3. After User and Winning Outcomes, CPU will be made.
            a. Updates the board where CPU places their 'o's.
            b. Generates valid entries.
        3. Add a validity check for inputs since right now user and CPU can each other's pieces.
